    <div>
      <p>I‚Äôve been thinking about this blog post for a while. It will be about tests not only for React, but for frontend projects 
        in general, specially for those using state management libraries like Redux. I‚Äôll try to differ between a unit test and 
        what I strongly consider to be an integration test.</p>

      <i>note: to write this post I've created a Git repo, and took the chance to try out Redux hooks as state management 
        and the React Testing Library instead of Enzyme, as I use to do. If you have any disagreement regarding code, feel free to 
        open an issue on the <a href=‚Äúhttps://github.com/jhfgloria/react-testing-library-spike‚Äù>repository</a>. Please consider 
        that no refactor was made, nor any concern for performance was taken.</i>

      <p>The reference project is the usual To Do list. We start with an empty list, with an input to introduce new To Dos, and 
        a button to add them to the list. Simple, right? ü§ô As simple as it gets, but I really like testing software and this adds 
        some extra work to it.</p>

      <h2>Part I - Representational unit tests</h2>

      <p>A To Do is just something that shows a task üìù, is complete ‚úÖ or not, and that has a click event üëá.</p>

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/jhfgloria/ae373887f44c917a99c5c7c131931204.js?file=todo.jsx"></script>

      <p>First things first: unit tests. So what do we want to test in a To Do? 1) That a user can see a task, 2) that a completed 
        To Do is rendered differently and 3) that clicking on it causes effects. And that‚Äôs what we did.</p>

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/jhfgloria/ae373887f44c917a99c5c7c131931204.js?file=todo.test.jsx"></script>

      <p>We are just testing the To Do as a view. A representational piece of information. 
        Look at how we tested "how" a completed To Do "should look like" (having a done class that changes its appearance) because that's 
        representational logic, but not what a click should do. That we are going to find out later.</p>

      <p>A To Do List is the aggregation of all To Dos (if any) and a way of introducing new To Dos (in this case using a form).</p>

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/jhfgloria/ae373887f44c917a99c5c7c131931204.js?file=todo-list.jsx"></script>

      <p>Again, we want to test the representational logic of the To Do List view: 1) that it can show 1 or more To Dos in a list,
        2) that it renders an input and a button (that will allow us to introduce new To Dos), 3) that changing the input causes 
        effects, and 4) that clicking on the button causes effects. Again, both when changing the input or clicking the button only
        "causes effects". We are not disclosing which ones, because from a representational point of view it doesn't make any sense.</p>

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/jhfgloria/ae373887f44c917a99c5c7c131931204.js?file=todo-list.test.jsx"></script>
      
      <p>Now that we got rid of the views (or components), let us talk about the state of the application. And that we will tackle
        with Redux. I'm not explaining how Redux works (maybe in a future blog post ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è), but long story short we need the so-called 
        "reducers" that generate an immutable snapshot of a store (state).</p>

      <h2>Part II - State unit tests</h2>
      
      <p>For this example we only need a single store: the ToDos store. This store should have an array of ToDos and a ToDo to
        update and store in the array. The reducer that generates this store should handle three different action types:
        <span class="code">COMPLETE_TODO</span>, <span class="code">ADD_TODO</span> and <span class="code">CHANGE_TODO</span>.
        I think the name of the action types and the code below explain the purpose of each one.</p>

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/jhfgloria/ae373887f44c917a99c5c7c131931204.js?file=reducer.js"></script>

      <p>The tests for a reducer are quite simpler than for a component, at least for me. Mostly because Redux is a library
        that follows a functional programming style, and reducers are pure functions.</p>

      <p>Basically, what we do here is to create a first snapshot of the store, and then passing an action we expect a new
        snapshot. We do this for the three actions: 1) add a ToDo to the array of ToDos, 2) update the store ToDo, and 3) 
        complete a ToDo in the array by name.</p>

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/jhfgloria/ae373887f44c917a99c5c7c131931204.js?file=reducer.test.js"></script>

      <h2>Part III - Integration tests</h2>

      <p>Finally, we reached the part of the post I've been waiting for. This is what in frontend I call an integration
        test or, for the more demanding ones, an E2E test, since it is testing two real components together.</p>
      
      <p>Here we put the views and the state together, and make sure that everything works as expected.</p>

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/jhfgloria/ae373887f44c917a99c5c7c131931204.js?file=connected-list.jsx"></script>

      <p>As you can see in the code below, this kind of tests need more setup than unit tests, because normally you would need to
        bind the state with the views. Using Redux hooks, we do this with the Context API, providing the state in an upper
        component.</p>

      <p>Here we're testing that whenever something happens in the store, that reflects in the view, like adding a ToDo,
        changing the ToDo using the input or completing a ToDo by clicking on it. Also, here is when it makes sense to test
        the click and input behavior because it is no longer representational. When composing everything together we have to
        test how the views interact with the whole system.</p>

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/jhfgloria/ae373887f44c917a99c5c7c131931204.js?file=integration.test.js"></script>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Long story short, from what I've been doing for some time (and you can follow this line of thought, or maybe have your
        own), tests in frontend are really straighforward.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>Test your views as views only! (keep the behavior out of it)</p></li>
        <li><p>Test your services/state management independently! (and mind my word, functional services/functions are way easier
          to test than non-functional ones)</p></li>
        <li><p>Test everything together to make sure that your application/system works as expected!</p></li>
      </ul>

      <p>I know this is not an explanatory post, because I'm hiding some details of implementation and not really explaining
        the technologies used. If you are interested in the code you can find it in 
        <a href=‚Äúhttps://github.com/jhfgloria/react-testing-library-spike‚Äù>here</a>.</p>

      <p>Hope you enjoyed it. üòô</p>
