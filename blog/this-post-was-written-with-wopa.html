      <h2>135 commits ago I started something I never thought I would write about, even less write about it using the
        thing itself. It started as a pet project, but I do think theres is potential for more. This thing is called
        wopa.</h2>
      <h2>What is this wopa all about?</h2>
      <p>In 2019 I started blogging. I decided to create my own website using no more than old and reliable HTML and
        CSS, where I would also include a tab for a blog. Suddenly I looked at myself writing blog posts on VS Code
        using HTML tags to format the text and making sure it was exactly like the ones I wrote before. Because I do
        start pet projects more often that I would like, this time I started something that I felt I could be a user of.
        What I eventually called wopa was going to be an online editor that would produce me text as HTML, but my love
        for products made me start something else.</p>
      <h2>What is wopa right now?</h2>
      <p>Generating HTML for text content felt short and I quickly developed something that did exactly that. Since I
        had something working I realised that a way to put my content out and reach more people was to not only post it
        on my personal blog, but also on popular blogs like Medium. And that's where the name comes from. I stole the
        popular slogan from Java "write once run anywhere" and adapt it to "write once PUBLISH anywhere". And wopa was
        born. This still-in-progress web application is now capable of exporting your text content to readable HTML and
        publish your content into Medium. Not much I know, but it has been a one-man-show since day 1,&nbsp;but more
        importantly, it was a great opportunity for learning.</p>
      <h2>Major challenges</h2>
      <p>One thing I never realised before starting this project was how to develop a web text editor that would support
        multiple styling like headers, paragraphs and so on. After some investigation I adopt the content-editable
        strategy. I don't regret this approach but I found a lot of problems. It seems that to have full control over
        the content-editable element you lose the caret (the line that keeps flashing in the position you are writing)
        position. This is a major problem because the caret should go in front of what the user inputs or where s/he
        navigates with mouse or keyboard. As solution I ended up removing all keyboard shortcuts that make use of SHIFT
        or COMMAND because there are some use cases not covered. This is a huge impact in the usability and is a still
        in progress concern.</p>
      <p>I'm mostly a frontend developer with React experience and enough NodeJS experience to make small things in the
        realm of the backend. Trying to do things from scratch in NodeJS and Express instead of picking a framework made
        a huge impact in my velocity, even more when doing TDD most of the time. Also my lack of experience in
        infrastructure delayed me at some times.</p>
      <h2>Lessons learned</h2>
      <p>Looking back, there are things that I would do differently starting something from scratch.</p>
      <p>First I would never pick up React or any other frontend framework unless I definitively need it. wopa editor is
        very interactive and I could have used React to develop it, but the rest of the platform could have been done
        using server-side rendering with the help of a backend framework. At least this opinion of mine stands for an
        MVP point of view.</p>
      <p>With few experience in backend I would most probably have benefited from using a framework like Rails, or
        Phoenix, even NestJS. Using their scaffolding capabilities I would have a different pace and this blog post
        would have been delivered to you sooner. Not to say that I did not learn anything because it was a hell of a
        ride developing wopa, so far.</p>
      <p>Despite being so fun to develop the editor from scratch from an MVP stand point, I could have picked an already
        ready for production open source editor; at least pick one where I wouldn't need to control the caret.</p>
      <h2>Next steps</h2>
      <p>There's still plenty to do in wopa. I still feel there is potential to turn wopa into a tool that most content
        creators would definitively want to have on their tool belt.</p>
      <p>Something that needs my love and care is the editor itself. As a crucial part of the application, I
        definitively need to increase its usability. First I need to restore the mouse and keyboard events back -
        writing is easier with keyboard shortcuts. Then, adding more features like using images or code snippets would
        be a most.</p>
      <p>Integrations, integrations, integrations. The thing I believe to be the future of wopa is having a lot of
        integrations so that users can reach the maximum readers as possible. Right now I only have Medium, but the
        purpose is to have as many as I can integrate with.</p>
      <p>Creating a desktop application was something that already crossed my mind - have users writing their content
        even offline would be a huge feature for a web text editor.</p>
      <p>Feel free to try wopa. It is free and still in its beta phase. Feedback, good or bad is always appreciated!</p>
